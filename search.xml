    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="EE5903-Real-time-Systems"><a href="#EE5903-Real-time-Systems" class="headerlink" title="EE5903 Real-time Systems"></a>EE5903 Real-time Systems</h3><p>This is one of the 2 compulsory modules you need to take (the other one is EE5902 Multiprocessor Systems), if you opt for a specialisation in Computer Engineering under NUS EE graduate coursework program. Module is taught by Professor Bharadwaj Veeravalli (also the instructor for EE5902).</p>
<p><u> Content: </u><br>Real time task scheduling algorithms, reliability and fault-tolerance, process synchronization</p>
<p><u> Assignment: </u><br>20% CA1 + 30% CA2 + 50% final exam</p>
<p>This module has 2 assignments and the contents of the 2 assignment are related. You are required to form a group of 2 before the first assignment (You can choose the group). You and your group mate then select the assignment topic of interest (from the topic list provided), search 4 recent papers related to the topic (published from 2014 onwards for my batch) and discuss with the professor for approval.</p>
<p>CA1 is a group assignment, in which your group need to read the 4 papers and write a literature review report. The key point of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of the concepts and algorithms presented in the papers.</p>
<p>CA2 is an individual assignment, you and your group mate each need to implement 2 different algorithms from the 4 papers separately. The detail on how to implement the algorithms would be discussed with professor during the consultation session. You can choose any programming language that you feel the most comfortable to use.</p>
<p>Final exam is closed-book with a double sided A4 size cheatsheet allowed. It is mostly to test on concept and theory questions. Going through all the lecture notes and supplementary example questions taught during the lecture would definitely be sufficient.</p>
<p>The detail information for both content and assignment can also be found in the course website:<br><a href="http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/elebv/EE5903_BV/">http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/elebv/EE5903_BV/</a></p>
<p><u> Personal thought: </u><br>In general, this module is not difficult, if you have a relevant undergraduate background. The lecture contents are those very classical theories, which serve as a good introduction knowledge to people like me who do not have a relevant undergraduate background. However, for those who want to go into deeper or more advanced topics, the contents may seem to be a little bit outdated or insufficient. Assignments are a bit challenging since they are almost not related to the lecture contents at all, you need to digest the academic papers and implement the algorithms on your own. It tends to train you and get you more prepared for independent research and perhaps this is the most different aspect compared to undergraduate modules.</p>
<h3 id="EE5907-Pattern-Recognition"><a href="#EE5907-Pattern-Recognition" class="headerlink" title="EE5907 Pattern Recognition"></a>EE5907 Pattern Recognition</h3><p>This module is one of the elective modules for specialisation in Computer Engineering.</p>
<p><u> Content: </u><br>The first part is taught by Professor Thomas Yeo, it mainly covers Bayesian probability, generative and discriminative models parameter estimation, logistic regression and KNN.</p>
<p>For our batch, the second part is taught by Professor Toh Kar-Ann (visiting professor from Yonsei University, South Korea). Topics include linear discriminant function, PCA dimension reduction, feature extraction, SVM and boosting, and at the end, a simple introduction to neural networks and deep learning. (Usually this part is taught by Professor Feng Jiashi but contents are similar)</p>
<p><u> Assignment: </u><br>20% CA1 + 20% CA2 + 60% final exam</p>
<p>CA1 is an individual assignment that covers Professor Thomas Yeo’s part. There are in total 4 questions on the same training data set and each question requires you to use a different classification method. Questions are very straightforward, data set is also given in .mat format with all the features represented by values in columns. You can choose to code in either Matlab or Python.</p>
<p>CA2 is an individual assignment that covers Professor Toh’s part. Training data is MNIST handwritten digit, one of the most popular training databases (also known as the “Hello world” in machine learning). Similar to CA1, you will need to explore and implement different algorithms to classify the same training data and compare among them.</p>
<p>Our batch took online final exam due to Covid-19 and it was a quiz-base exam, so it cannot provide much reference to your batch. But as far as I know, it usually includes conceptual questions asking for explanation or justification, as well as some simple calculation questions mainly about Bayesian probability.</p>
<p><u> Personal thought: </u><br>I would say that this module gives a very good introduction to machine learning as it covers almost all the very fundamental concepts. It is a very popular module offered in both Semester 1 and 2. Moreover, if you plan to take EE5934 Deep Learning later, this module is a pre-requisite. I strongly recommend this module if you are curious about machine learning. For difficulty level, if you have some background knowledge in probability, statistics and linear algebra, then you should be able to manage this module without much problem.</p>
<h3 id="EE5902-Multiprocessor-Systems"><a href="#EE5902-Multiprocessor-Systems" class="headerlink" title="EE5902 Multiprocessor Systems"></a>EE5902 Multiprocessor Systems</h3><p>Similar to EE5903 in last semester, this module is also a compulsory module for Computer Engineering specialisation taught by Professor Bharadwaj Veeravalli.</p>
<p><u> Content: </u><br>Different computer architectures, parallel computing, multi-core and multi-thread concepts, cache, pipeline.</p>
<p><u> Assignment: </u><br>40% CA + 60% final exam</p>
<p>This module has only one group assignment. At the beginning of the course, you need to form a group of 2. For my batch, group allocation was done by professor so these is chance that you don’t know your group mate. There are 2 assignment types: survey type and simulation type, you and your group mate can discuss and decide to go for any one type for the CA. Survey type requires your group to search and do a literature review for 6 papers, while simulation type requires your group to study and implement 4 algorithms (2 algorithms per person). The assignment style is very similar to those in EE5903, if you have taken EE5903, you should be very familiar with the assignment procedure for this module, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Final exam is closed-book with a double sided A4 size cheatsheet allowed. Again, exam style is also very similar to that in EE5903. Questions are very standard and similar to those sample questions. Exam syllabus, practice problems and question bank with solutions are released by professor during reading week for you to better prepare for your exam, they are quite helpful so please make sure you go through them before your actual exam.</p>

<p><u> Personal thought: </u><br>Content difficulty is standard. Lecture workload is not heavy (6 chapters in total). However, lecture notes are quite messy and informal, one chapter may consist of several separate documents differ largely in format or presentation style, some are even hand-written materials. So I suggest you to follow professor‘s pace in lecture if possible, or watch the recording together with the lecture slides to prevent from getting lost. Assignment is a bit difficult and has nothing much to do with the lecture itself. Your mark depends on how much effort you spend on those papers.</p>
<h3 id="EE5731-Visual-Computing"><a href="#EE5731-Visual-Computing" class="headerlink" title="EE5731 Visual Computing"></a>EE5731 Visual Computing</h3><p>This module is taught by Professor Robby T. Tan. Personally I feel that this module should be counted as elective module for Computer Engineering specialisation, but I am not sure why actually it is not inside the elective module list.</p>
<p><u> Content: </u><br>Face detection, image feature extraction, image stitching, camera geometric properties, Markov Random Field, depth from stereo and video, optical flow</p>
<p><u> Assignment: </u><br>30% CA1 + 30% CA2 + 40% final exam</p>
<p>CA1 is an individual assignment about panoramic image stitching. There are in total 7 parts, while the last part is an advanced part that is not taught during the class and requires you to read the papers on your own. Some parts are related to each other.</p>
<p>CA2 is also an individual assignment about depth estimation from stereo and video. There are in total 5 parts and similarly the last part here is an advanced part not discussed in class.</p>
<p>Both assignments use Matlab as the coding language and involve extensive amount of coding. Workload is very heavy compared to other modules (e.g. I spent about 60% of assignment time on this module for that semester based on rough estimation, and I took 3 modules in that semester). For the advanced parts in both assignments, you really need to spend extra effort if you want to do it, but according to what I know from my surrounding, not many people completed this part.</p>
<p>Our batch took online final exam due to Covid-19 and it was a quiz-base exam, so it cannot provide much reference to your batch. However, I have checked the past-year papers from NUS Library during my revision period, the papers look very difficult with a lot of explanation or description type of questions. Even for the online exam in my batch, the 25 multiple response questions made most of us exhausted at the end (one thing is the questions itself were really tough, another thing is that no partial mark was given for any under-select or over-select answer, to some extent this quiz-base exam is even more cruel than past-year exams).</p>

<p><u> Personal thought: </u><br>Unlike other popular computer vision course (e.g. CS231N Stanford), this module only presents traditional CV approaches without any deep learning framework. However, I agree with what professor said during the class, traditional CV is the foundation and it helps you understand the mathematics behinds and how computer perceive images. Therefore, it is still a good course to choose if you are interested in CV, or plan to embark on this area. Professor Robby seems quite strict in teaching and giving marks. He is also the only professor I know so far that really spends up 3 hours fully for every week’s lecture. I like his neat and organised handwritten lecture notes also haha.</p>
<h3 id="ME5405-Machine-Vision"><a href="#ME5405-Machine-Vision" class="headerlink" title="ME5405 Machine Vision"></a>ME5405 Machine Vision</h3><p>This module is from Mechanical Engineering department.</p>
<p><u> Content: </u><br>The first part of this module is taught by Professor Chui Chee Kong. Topics include image acquisition, image geometry and noise filtering in frequency domain. The second part is taught by Professor Lim Kah Bin, topics include binary machine vision, image enhancement and segmentation, color image processing.</p>
<p><u> Assignment: </u><br>30% CA + 70% final exam</p>
<p>There is only one group assignment. The project is released at the beginning of the course and you group has almost the whole semester time to finish it. It is a coding project that requires you to process two provided images according to the steps mentioned in the question sheet. Code need to be written in Matlab. Questions are relatively straightforward and easy.</p>
<p>Final exam is open-book. Questions are mainly calculation type. If you go through all the lecture notes and the sample questions with solutions before the exam, you should be able to handle it without any issue.</p>
<p><u> Personal thought: </u><br>This module does not require any pre-requisite knowledge and is not difficult to score. If you are interested in image processing, or if you cannot find a suitable module to take for the semester, try consider this module.</p>
